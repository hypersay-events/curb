1
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,712
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,137
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,823
<i>called the war 'Judgment Day'.</i>

4
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,861
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare--</i>

5
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,876
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,485
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:49,423
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:53,394
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance...</i>

9
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,955
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:02,224
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...</i>

11
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,176
<i>in the year 1984...</i>

12
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,490
<i>before John was born.</i>

13
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,315
<i>lt failed.</i>

14
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,131
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

15
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,554
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

16
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:20,697
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

17
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,972
<i>a protector for John.</i>

18
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,302
<i>lt was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

19
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:33,728
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,424
You forgot to say 'please'.

21
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,092
Get him off me!

22
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,128
Pull it out!

23
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,551
Take it.

24
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:12,493
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

25
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,283
Now, get off
before I put you down.

26
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,102
That's it, goddamn it.

27
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,398
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

28
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:30,229
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

29
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,405
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

30
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:09,192
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

31
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,383
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

32
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,649
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

33
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,270
-He won't even answer me anymore.
-Honey, move.

34
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,158
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

35
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,939
-Todd!
-What?

36
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:37,236
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

37
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,303
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

38
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,395
Come on.

39
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:52,564
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

40
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,342
She's not my mother, Todd.

41
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,383
This next patient is interesting.

42
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:25,810
I've been following the case
for years.

43
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,893
A 29-year-old female...

44
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,697
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

45
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,899
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

46
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:37,626
delusions of persecution.

47
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,036
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

48
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,819
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

49
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:52,604
which looks human, of course,
was sent back through time...

50
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,156
-to kill her.
-That's original.

51
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:58,331
And also that the father
of her child...

52
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:01,562
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

53
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,486
He was from the future too.

54
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:07,992
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

55
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:10,170
And here we are.

56
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:11,991
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

57
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,935
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

58
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,584
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

59
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,845
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

60
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:30,297
with my pen a few weeks ago.

61
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,767
Repeated escape attempts.

62
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,842
Let's move on, shall we?

63
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,106
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

64
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,565
-See she takes her Thorazine.
-Sure. I'll take care of it.

65
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:05,600
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

66
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,331
You take it.

67
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,798
Now you know you gotta be good...

68
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,629
because you're up for review
this afternoon.

69
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:14,375
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

70
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,489
Ain't no trouble.

71
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:22,562
Yeah, zap her.

72
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,659
Last call, sugar.

73
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,340
Sweet dreams.

74
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,266
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

75
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,235
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

76
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:19,142
-Could I speak with him, please?
-You could if he were here.

77
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:21,967
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

78
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,271
Do you have a photograph of John?

79
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,516
Yeah. Hold on.

80
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:30,508
Gonna tell me what this is about?

81
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,035
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

82
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,841
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

83
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:41,259
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

84
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,438
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

85
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:45,843
Has that got something
to do with this?

86
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:52,014
I wouldn't worry about him.

87
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,804
Thanks for your cooperation.

88
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:58,643
Please insert your stolen card now.

89
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,283
PIN number.

90
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,001
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

91
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,502
Go, baby.

92
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,415
All right.

93
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,070
-PIN number 9003.
-Where'd you learn this stuff from?

94
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,528
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

95
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:24,696
Withdraw 300 bucks.

96
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:27,449
Come on, baby. Come on!

97
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,689
-Yes!
-Hey, it worked.

98
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:33,684
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

99
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,682
Yes! Piece of cake.

100
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,748
-Is that her?
-Yes.

101
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,610
She's pretty cool, huh?

102
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:49,847
No, she's a complete psycho.

103
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:52,502
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

104
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,110
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

105
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,156
No shit.

106
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,171
She's a total loser.

107
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,823
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

108
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,774
Sarah...

109
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,561
Sarah, wake up.

110
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,005
Kyle.

111
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:46,946
You're dead.

112
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,955
Where's our son, Sarah?

113
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,097
They took him away from me.

114
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,232
-He's the target now.
-I know.

115
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,310
He's all alone
and you have to protect him.

116
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,718
I know.

117
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,270
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

118
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:04,417
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

119
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:08,351
-I've lost him.
-You're strong, Sarah.

120
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,781
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

121
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,150
On your feet, soldier!

122
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:16,521
I love you, Sarah.

123
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,757
I always will.

124
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,122
I need you.

125
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,820
I'll always be with you.

126
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:29,921
Remember the message?

127
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,752
The future is not set.

128
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,265
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

129
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,327
Stay with me.

130
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,975
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

131
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,862
Kyle, don't go!

132
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,466
Kyle!

133
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,860
<i>lt's like a giant strobe light...</i>

134
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,172
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

135
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:44,405
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

136
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,773
<i>Oh, God.</i>

137
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:58,430
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

138
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:01,726
<i>-Why do I have to--
-Please continue.</i>

139
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,932
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

140
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,546
<i>Black.</i>

141
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,473
<i>Not moving.</i>

142
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,537
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

143
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:29,055
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

144
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:31,806
<i>Dreams...</i>

145
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,984
<i>of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

146
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:35,910
<i>are very common.</i>

147
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:41,602
<i>lt's not a dream, you moron.
lt's real.</i>

148
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:45,469
<i>-I know the date it happens.
-I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

149
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:47,934
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

150
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:51,391
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin'real to you too!</i>

151
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:55,906
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

152
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:56,928
<i>Get it?</i>

153
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,751
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

154
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:02,022
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

155
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,514
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

156
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:07,370
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

157
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:11,331
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!</i>

158
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,258
<i>lt happened!</i>

159
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:26,725
I feel much better now.

160
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,621
Clearer.

161
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:31,370
Yes, your attitude has been...

162
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:33,643
much improved lately.

163
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,967
It's helped me to have a goal...

164
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:48,140
something to look forward to.

165
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,289
What is that?

166
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,630
Well, you said...

167
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:55,408
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

168
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:58,028
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

169
00:23:58,066 --> 00:24:00,749
and I could have visitors.

170
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,746
Well, it's been six months...

171
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,194
and...

172
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:09,456
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

173
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:12,340
I see.

174
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:18,993
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

175
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:23,383
Now you think they don't exist?

176
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:25,718
They don't exist.

177
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,411
I know that now.

178
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:30,515
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

179
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,593
in a hydraulic press.

180
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:36,914
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

181
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:39,319
They would have found something
at the factory.

182
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,425
I see.

183
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:44,761
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

184
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:49,722
No. Why would they?

185
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:52,915
Let's try a new position
right there.

186
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:05,625
Mr. Dyson?

187
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:08,214
The materials team
is running another--

188
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:09,879
-Mr. Dyson.
-Yes?

189
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:12,820
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

190
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,732
You have to sign for the--it.

191
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:18,525
-You have to sign it out.
-Okay. I'll get it.

192
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:24,314
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know--

193
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:25,694
Know what?

194
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:28,314
If you know where "it" came from.

195
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:31,669
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

196
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:33,600
Don't ask.

197
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:42,201
-Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
-How's it going?

198
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:45,112
Insert key.
Left on three.

199
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,425
Two, one, turn.

200
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,439
-How are the wife and kids?
-Great. Thanks.

201
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,471
So what do you think, Doctor?

202
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:25,353
I have shown improvement,
haven't I?

203
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,095
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

204
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,489
I know how smart you are.

205
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,465
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

206
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,436
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

207
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:42,218
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

208
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:49,097
You have to let me see my son.

209
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:51,814
Please.

210
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:58,697
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

211
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,444
If I could make a phone call--

212
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,877
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

213
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,389
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

214
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,888
that you stay here
for another six months.

215
00:27:13,937 --> 00:27:17,101
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

216
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,985
You son of a bitch!

217
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:25,138
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

218
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,632
You don't know what you're doing!

219
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:28,747
Get some restraints in here now!

220
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:33,325
You don't know what you're doing!

221
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:39,218
<i>Model citizen.</i>

222
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:19,254
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

223
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:22,391
-He was going to the Galleria.
-Yeah.

224
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:24,152
The Galleria?

225
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,589
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

226
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,621
-Oh, no!
-Girls, do you know John Connor?

227
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,859
Hey, do you know this guy?

228
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,001
Nah, I don't know him.

229
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:43,431
-John.
-Not now.

230
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:46,629
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

231
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,921
-He's right over there.
-Split, man.

232
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,343
-Just go.
-Yeah.

233
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,046
I saw that kid--

234
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,630
You're not supposed to
be in here!

235
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,452
Get down.

236
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,414
Mister, are you all right?

237
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,687
You all right?

238
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,529
Come on!

239
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,158
Goddamn!

240
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,500
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

241
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,058
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

242
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,230
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

243
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:39,602
-You are a Terminator, right?
-Yes.

244
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,353
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

245
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,348
Holy shit.

246
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:59,279
You're really real.

247
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,206
I mean--

248
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,478
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

249
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,982
But alive outside?

250
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,912
I'm a cybernetic organism.

251
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:12,562
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

252
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:28,885
This is intense.

253
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,607
Get a grip, John. Okay.

254
00:38:34,076 --> 00:38:36,150
You're not here to kill me.

255
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,020
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

256
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:42,711
My mission is to protect you.

257
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,303
Yeah? Who sent you?

258
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,575
You did.

259
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,753
35 years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

260
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,520
to be your protector here,
in this time.

261
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,954
to be your protector here,
in this time.

262
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,290
Oh, this is deep.

263
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,225
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

264
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:23,193
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

265
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:26,461
More advanced than you are?

266
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,083
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

267
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:30,877
What the hell does that mean?

268
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,802
Liquid metal.

269
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:35,038
Where are we going?

270
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:37,823
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

271
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:41,021
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

272
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:45,662
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

273
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:48,387
-You sure?
-I would.

274
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:01,119
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

275
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,698
but I gotta warn 'em.

276
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:07,076
Shit. You got a quarter?

277
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:18,367
<i>-Hello.
-Janelle, it's me.</i>

278
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:20,711
<i>-John?
-Is everything all right?</i>

279
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:23,112
<i>-Are you guys okay?
-Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

280
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:26,145
<i>-Are you all right?
-Yeah, l'm fine.</i>

281
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:29,666
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

282
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:32,324
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

283
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:33,889
I'm making beef stew.

284
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,800
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

285
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:38,565
Where are you?

286
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,418
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

287
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:44,615
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

288
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,145
The dog's really barking.

289
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:48,327
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

290
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,697
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

291
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,392
Could he already be there?

292
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:58,795
Are you okay?

293
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,692
<i>-I'm right here. I'm fine.
-Are you sure you're all right?</i>

294
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:05,932
-What's the dog's name?
-Max.

295
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,302
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

296
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,856
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

297
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:14,639
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

298
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,329
Where are you?

299
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,889
Your foster parents are dead.

300
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,134
I need a minute here.

301
00:41:57,176 --> 00:42:01,366
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

302
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:04,248
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

303
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:05,711
Get real.

304
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:09,398
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

305
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:11,321
No, only an object
of equal size.

306
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:13,848
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

307
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:15,854
It can't form complex machines.

308
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:18,416
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

309
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:19,797
It doesn't work that way.

310
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,385
-But it can form solid metal shapes.
-Like what?

311
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,465
Knives and stabbing weapons.

312
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:56,156
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

313
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,638
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

314
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:03,732
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

315
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,102
Men with families...

316
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:09,983
children.

317
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:13,789
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

318
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,451
today.

319
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:20,487
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

320
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:27,095
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

321
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,920
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

322
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:31,581
We know this guy's involved.

323
00:43:32,642 --> 00:43:35,872
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

324
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:41,946
We're wasting our time.

325
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:44,061
Let's go.

326
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,590
Sorry, guys.

327
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,755
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

328
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,994
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

329
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:56,162
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

330
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,726
Sure.

331
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:00,701
Douglas, take her back to her room.

332
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:01,823
Yes, sir.

333
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:05,374
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

334
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:07,488
You see...

335
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:10,628
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

336
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:16,009
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

337
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,384
running guns.

338
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,288
Then there were some other guys.

339
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:22,274
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

340
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:25,414
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

341
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,090
Then she gets busted.

342
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:32,611
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

343
00:44:34,732 --> 00:44:38,475
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

344
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:41,095
I hated her for that.

345
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:46,793
But everything she said was true.

346
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:49,903
She knew...

347
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,991
and nobody believed her...

348
00:44:55,631 --> 00:44:57,518
not even me.

349
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:01,199
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

350
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:04,461
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

351
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:07,465
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

352
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:09,545
Great. What happens to her?

353
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,401
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

354
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:15,566
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

355
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,643
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

356
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:19,789
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

357
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:25,418
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

358
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,250
This does not help our mission.

359
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,675
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

360
00:45:29,718 --> 00:45:32,686
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

361
00:45:32,726 --> 00:45:33,740
Let me go!

362
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:39,827
Why did you do that?

363
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:41,718
Because you told me to.

364
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,813
What?

365
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:52,558
You have to do what I say?

366
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,772
That's one of my mission parameters.

367
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,345
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

368
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:02,767
Yes!

369
00:46:04,826 --> 00:46:08,308
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

370
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:10,969
You okay, kid?

371
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:12,377
Take a hike, bozo.

372
00:46:12,411 --> 00:46:14,933
Let's get outta here, man.

373
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,794
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

374
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,907
Dipshit?

375
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:23,029
Put your leg down.

376
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:27,740
<i>-Did you call moi a dipshit?
-Just trying to help this punk.</i>

377
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:30,044
Grab this guy.

378
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:32,760
Get him off of me!

379
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:34,839
Now who's the dipshit...

380
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,603
you jock douche bag?

381
00:46:45,313 --> 00:46:47,702
Put the gun down now!

382
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,876
-Get outta here!
-Come on. Let's split!

383
00:46:57,506 --> 00:46:59,416
You were gonna kill that guy!

384
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:01,531
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

385
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,205
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

386
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:09,506
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

387
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,875
You got that?

388
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:14,146
You just can't go around
killing people.

389
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:15,164
Why?

390
00:47:16,102 --> 00:47:18,174
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

391
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:21,925
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

392
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:31,037
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

393
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,829
I order you to help me.

394
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:57,695
You have a Sarah Connor here?

395
00:49:57,727 --> 00:49:59,321
You're runnin' kind of late.

396
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,749
They've been in there for an hour.

397
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,127
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

398
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:09,534
Oh, here come your friends now.

399
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:12,128
-Gwen, you want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

400
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,041
-How 'bout a beer?
-Yeah, right.

401
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:41,067
-Hey, I got a full house.
-That's good, Louis.

402
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:43,340
Must be my lucky day.

403
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:02,681
You're right about number 24.

404
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:05,627
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

405
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:08,450
-Same kind?
-Mm-hmm.

406
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:24,901
You!

407
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:29,192
You broke my arm.

408
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,908
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

409
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:34,467
That's one. Now, don't move.

410
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,762
What are you going to do?

411
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:47,202
Why do we stop now?

412
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:52,104
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

413
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:54,660
-Right.
-Swear?

414
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,161
What?

415
00:54:56,203 --> 00:54:59,204
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

416
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:02,571
I swear I will not kill anyone.

417
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,507
All right. Let's go.

418
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:12,804
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

419
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,050
Monday through Friday.

420
00:55:18,575 --> 00:55:19,786
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:22,344
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

422
00:55:24,048 --> 00:55:25,357
Crazy bastard!

423
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:31,628
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

424
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:36,912
He'll live.

425
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,878
Son of a bitch!

426
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:55,538
Let's try to remain calm.

427
00:55:55,573 --> 00:55:57,461
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

428
00:55:57,493 --> 00:55:59,500
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

429
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,998
-Open the door.
-It ain't gonna happen.

430
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:03,861
Take it easy, Sarah.

431
00:56:03,895 --> 00:56:06,928
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

432
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:09,870
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

433
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:11,887
So don't fuck with me!

434
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,587
Open the door!

435
00:56:20,123 --> 00:56:21,747
Back off!

436
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,192
Get back!

437
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:25,112
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

438
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:28,401
Don't move!

439
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:30,644
Drop the shit!

440
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:32,505
Do it!

441
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:34,426
Get in the office.

442
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:36,466
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

443
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:38,166
Open the door.

444
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,267
On the floor. Hold it open.

445
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:44,188
Face the wall!

446
00:56:59,488 --> 00:57:01,276
Get her!

447
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,714
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

448
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:33,570
Let's go! Open it!

449
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,852
-She broke it off.
-Open it!

450
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:45,252
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

451
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,155
Mom, wait!

452
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,675
Come back here!

453
00:58:29,102 --> 00:58:30,695
-Help her!
-Wait here.

454
00:58:30,734 --> 00:58:33,223
-Hurry up!
-He'll kill us all!

455
00:58:34,446 --> 00:58:35,657
Hold her.

456
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:38,247
He'll kill us all!

457
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,806
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

458
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,434
Come with me
if you want to live.

459
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:10,923
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

460
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:35,631
Go.

461
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,076
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

462
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,022
Get down.

463
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,955
Out of the car!

464
01:01:02,277 --> 01:01:03,422
Right now!

465
01:01:26,858 --> 01:01:27,841
Go!

466
01:01:38,636 --> 01:01:39,812
I'm out.

467
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:48,170
-Come on.
-Here.

468
01:01:50,604 --> 01:01:52,612
Reload.

469
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:03,077
Last one!

470
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:11,494
Hang on.

471
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,122
Ready!

472
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:53,110
Here, drive.

473
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:46,331
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

474
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:48,255
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

475
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:51,704
Can you see anything?

476
01:03:52,864 --> 01:03:54,042
I see everything.

477
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,360
Cool.

478
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:03,712
Come here.

479
01:04:09,187 --> 01:04:10,910
I said I was okay.

480
01:04:11,683 --> 01:04:14,651
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

481
01:04:15,587 --> 01:04:17,791
You have to be smarter
than that.

482
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:19,388
You were almost killed.

483
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:22,207
What were you thinking?

484
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:25,630
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

485
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:27,163
Do you understand?

486
01:04:27,205 --> 01:04:28,700
You're too important.

487
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:31,295
Do you understand?

488
01:04:34,054 --> 01:04:35,134
But...

489
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:40,355
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

490
01:04:40,935 --> 01:04:43,521
I didn't need your help.

491
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:52,252
What's wrong with your eyes?

492
01:04:54,149 --> 01:04:55,556
Nothing.

493
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:07,421
So, what's your story?

494
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:18,592
You okay?

495
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:20,041
Fine.

496
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:24,934
Say, that's a nice bike.

497
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,200
Watch it, lug nuts.

498
01:05:55,376 --> 01:05:58,671
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

499
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,388
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

500
01:06:02,288 --> 01:06:04,198
I bet.

501
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,142
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

502
01:06:07,185 --> 01:06:08,264
Correct.

503
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:15,985
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

504
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:20,327
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

505
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,467
John, help me with the light.

506
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,736
-Will these heal up?
-Yes.

507
01:06:26,772 --> 01:06:30,831
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

508
01:06:30,868 --> 01:06:33,869
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

509
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:36,757
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

510
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:39,637
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

511
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,077
so you can be...

512
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,882
you know, more human...

513
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:47,570
and not such a dork
all the time?

514
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:54,000
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

515
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:58,230
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

516
01:06:59,513 --> 01:07:01,880
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

517
01:07:01,913 --> 01:07:03,191
No.

518
01:07:04,699 --> 01:07:06,870
Can we reset the switch?

519
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:28,467
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

520
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,540
Do it.

521
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:45,750
Now open the port cover.

522
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,649
<i>Pull to break the seal.</i>

523
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,463
<i>Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.</i>

524
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:03,223
You can now access the CPU.

525
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:06,269
<i>-Do you see it?
-Yes.</i>

526
01:08:06,307 --> 01:08:10,105
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

527
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:11,523
<i>Pull.</i>

528
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,061
Do you see the pin switch?

529
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:50,921
No! No!

530
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:54,404
-Out of my way, John.
-Don't kill him.

531
01:08:54,443 --> 01:08:57,641
<i>lt, John, not him.
It.</i>

532
01:08:57,676 --> 01:09:01,059
<i>Okay, 'It'.
But we need 'It'.</i>

533
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:03,654
Listen to me.
You listen.

534
01:09:03,692 --> 01:09:05,765
We're better-off on our own.

535
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:07,595
But he's the only proof we have...

536
01:09:07,629 --> 01:09:10,050
of the future and the war
and all that.

537
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:11,467
Maybe.

538
01:09:13,934 --> 01:09:15,942
I don't trust it.

539
01:09:15,982 --> 01:09:17,608
But he's my friend, all right?

540
01:09:18,414 --> 01:09:21,132
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

541
01:09:21,168 --> 01:09:24,616
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

542
01:09:24,655 --> 01:09:26,696
If I'm ever supposed to be this
great military leader...

543
01:09:26,736 --> 01:09:30,446
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

544
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,021
Because if my own mother won't...

545
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:37,774
how do you expect anyone else to?

546
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,348
All right, play it your way.

547
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:03,469
Was there a problem?

548
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:04,973
No problem.

549
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,794
None whatsoever.

550
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,938
Are we learning yet?

551
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:56,692
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

552
01:11:00,244 --> 01:11:01,806
Just head south.

553
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:11,760
Keep it under 65.

554
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:14,647
-We don't want to be pulled over.
-Affirmative.

555
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:20,175
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

556
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:23,632
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

557
01:11:23,673 --> 01:11:25,876
<i>You say, ''No problemo''.</i>

558
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,710
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

559
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:33,878
<i>And if you want to shine them on,
it's ''Hasta la vista, baby.''</i>

560
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:36,533
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

561
01:11:37,052 --> 01:11:39,026
Yeah, or ''Later, dick-wad''.

562
01:11:39,068 --> 01:11:42,004
If someone gets upset,
you say, ''Chill out''.

563
01:11:42,045 --> 01:11:43,451
Or you can do combinations.

564
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:46,362
Chill out, dick-wad.

565
01:11:47,132 --> 01:11:49,074
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

566
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,164
<i>No problemo.</i>

567
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,620
You got any cash?

568
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:06,101
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

569
01:12:06,141 --> 01:12:07,766
Mom!

570
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:10,805
Get some food.

571
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,123
No sense of humor.

572
01:12:20,063 --> 01:12:23,675
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

573
01:12:24,544 --> 01:12:26,650
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

574
01:12:26,688 --> 01:12:28,511
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

575
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:30,488
Smile once in a while.

576
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:31,870
Smile?

577
01:12:31,905 --> 01:12:35,703
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

578
01:12:36,641 --> 01:12:40,220
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

579
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:42,911
Give me a break.

580
01:12:43,746 --> 01:12:45,689
Okay, bad example.

581
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:48,381
See that guy over there?

582
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:50,274
That's a smile.

583
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:10,235
That's good.

584
01:13:10,278 --> 01:13:13,955
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

585
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:21,961
Want some of my fries?

586
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,418
Need any help?

587
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,077
No.

588
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,904
-I got you!
-No, you didn't!

589
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:47,943
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

590
01:13:49,742 --> 01:13:50,952
People, I mean.

591
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:55,754
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

592
01:13:56,751 --> 01:13:59,599
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

593
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,028
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

594
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:07,462
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

595
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:08,746
Who's responsible?

596
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:12,231
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

597
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:13,962
Who is that?

598
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:17,796
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

599
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:22,155
Why him?

600
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,454
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

601
01:14:26,447 --> 01:14:27,758
Go on. Then what?

602
01:14:28,786 --> 01:14:31,633
In three years, Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

603
01:14:31,665 --> 01:14:33,041
of military computer systems.

604
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:36,882
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

605
01:14:36,914 --> 01:14:38,344
becoming fully unmanned.

606
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:41,354
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

607
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,981
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

608
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,184
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

609
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:50,318
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

610
01:14:50,356 --> 01:14:53,007
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

611
01:14:53,045 --> 01:14:57,201
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

612
01:14:58,197 --> 01:15:00,717
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

613
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:03,955
-Skynet fights back.
-Yes.

614
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:06,674
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

615
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:09,678
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

616
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,055
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

617
01:15:12,088 --> 01:15:13,976
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

618
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:15,896
Jesus.

619
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:19,992
How much do you know
about Dyson?

620
01:15:22,009 --> 01:15:23,896
I have detailed files.

621
01:15:25,018 --> 01:15:26,905
I want to know everything.

622
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,399
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

623
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,537
Miles.

624
01:15:46,777 --> 01:15:48,719
<i>Miles.</i>

625
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:07,575
Are you going to work all day?

626
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:11,356
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

627
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:12,698
Miles, it's Sunday.

628
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:15,384
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

629
01:16:16,893 --> 01:16:18,356
I can't...

630
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:20,599
I'm on a roll.

631
01:16:32,896 --> 01:16:35,100
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

632
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:38,137
-It's a neural net processor.
-I know. You told me.

633
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:41,242
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

634
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,899
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

635
01:16:43,936 --> 01:16:48,030
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

636
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:52,062
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

637
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:53,408
I really need to know...

638
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:56,443
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

639
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,962
Baby, I am this close.

640
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:01,978
Come here.

641
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:06,941
Imagine a jet airliner...

642
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:09,566
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

643
01:17:09,605 --> 01:17:11,427
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

644
01:17:13,702 --> 01:17:16,070
Meet the pilot.

645
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:19,105
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

646
01:17:19,145 --> 01:17:20,159
You don't need us.

647
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,550
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

648
01:17:23,593 --> 01:17:26,376
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

649
01:17:34,185 --> 01:17:36,706
I'm sorry.
Really.

650
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:40,869
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

651
01:17:43,403 --> 01:17:45,193
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

652
01:18:13,646 --> 01:18:14,857
Wait in the car.

653
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:53,806
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

654
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,408
Hey, big John.

655
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:17,135
What's up?

656
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,568
He's cool, Enrique.

657
01:19:19,608 --> 01:19:20,688
He's with me.

658
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:23,795
He's... Uncle Bob.

659
01:19:23,832 --> 01:19:25,872
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

660
01:19:25,913 --> 01:19:27,767
Uncle Bob, huh?

661
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:30,006
Okay.

662
01:19:36,699 --> 01:19:37,680
Drink?

663
01:19:42,684 --> 01:19:44,058
"Uncle Bob"?

664
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,827
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

665
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:51,447
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

666
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:54,332
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

667
01:19:57,021 --> 01:20:00,983
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

668
01:20:01,022 --> 01:20:02,910
How about the fillings in my teeth?

669
01:20:02,942 --> 01:20:05,047
Now, Enrique.

670
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:08,443
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

671
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,757
Let's go.

672
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:31,747
One thing about my mom--

673
01:20:33,923 --> 01:20:35,811
she always plans ahead.

674
01:20:46,243 --> 01:20:46,560
Excellent.

675
01:20:57,412 --> 01:21:00,957
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

676
01:21:00,995 --> 01:21:02,883
You got time to change it out?

677
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:06,177
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

678
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:07,674
Enrique.

679
01:21:07,716 --> 01:21:11,164
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

680
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,692
Sure.

681
01:21:13,732 --> 01:21:17,311
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

682
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,958
See, I grew up in places like this...

683
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:27,367
so I just thought
that's how people lived--

684
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,234
riding around in helicopters...

685
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:34,404
Iearning how to blow shit up.

686
01:21:35,816 --> 01:21:38,402
But then when my mom got busted...

687
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:40,742
I got put into a regular school.

688
01:21:41,352 --> 01:21:44,037
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

689
01:21:57,675 --> 01:21:59,780
Are you ever afraid?

690
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:01,924
No.

691
01:22:04,781 --> 01:22:06,407
Not even of dying?

692
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,809
No.

693
01:22:13,038 --> 01:22:17,162
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

694
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:21,028
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

695
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:28,843
Then it doesn't matter.

696
01:22:28,881 --> 01:22:32,363
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

697
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:49,741
That's definitely you.

698
01:23:00,596 --> 01:23:02,965
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

699
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:06,956
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

700
01:23:06,995 --> 01:23:08,883
He taught me engines.

701
01:23:08,915 --> 01:23:11,055
Hold here.

702
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:13,426
Mom screwed it up, of course.

703
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,848
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

704
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:18,608
and me being this world leader.

705
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:20,532
That'd be all she wrote.

706
01:23:21,813 --> 01:23:22,892
Torque wrench, please.

707
01:23:25,045 --> 01:23:26,255
Here.

708
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:29,392
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

709
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:31,154
You will.

710
01:23:31,191 --> 01:23:33,330
Yeah, I guess.

711
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:37,077
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

712
01:23:37,111 --> 01:23:40,724
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

713
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:42,167
Man.

714
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:45,976
He hasn't even been born yet.

715
01:23:47,671 --> 01:23:49,561
It messes with your head.

716
01:23:52,154 --> 01:23:55,001
-The other bolt.
-Oh. Here.

717
01:24:01,051 --> 01:24:04,499
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

718
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,929
She still loves him, I guess.

719
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:09,786
I see her crying sometimes.

720
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,099
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

721
01:24:18,398 --> 01:24:19,893
Why do you cry?

722
01:24:20,926 --> 01:24:22,388
-You mean people?
-Yeah.

723
01:24:22,431 --> 01:24:23,806
I don't know.

724
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,879
We just cry...

725
01:24:25,919 --> 01:24:28,408
you know, when it hurts.

726
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:35,932
Pain causes it?

727
01:24:36,929 --> 01:24:39,001
No. It's different.

728
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,238
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

729
01:24:42,273 --> 01:24:43,834
-You get it?
-No.

730
01:24:45,025 --> 01:24:46,717
All right, my man!

731
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:48,249
<i>No problemo.</i>

732
01:24:48,419 --> 01:24:49,979
Give me five.

733
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,979
Just put out your hand
like this.

734
01:24:55,268 --> 01:24:59,425
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

735
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,330
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

736
01:25:07,237 --> 01:25:08,514
Five low.

737
01:25:09,222 --> 01:25:10,204
Too slow.

738
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,234
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

739
01:25:15,271 --> 01:25:17,442
Good. Now try it.

740
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,367
Now do me.
Give me five.

741
01:25:20,744 --> 01:25:25,153
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

742
01:25:25,193 --> 01:25:28,040
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

743
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:31,903
<i>lt would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

744
01:25:31,945 --> 01:25:35,262
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

745
01:25:35,306 --> 01:25:37,793
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

746
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:40,675
<i>lt would always be there...</i>

747
01:25:40,714 --> 01:25:43,299
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

748
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:47,880
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

749
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:49,891
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

750
01:25:49,932 --> 01:25:52,233
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

751
01:25:52,941 --> 01:25:54,764
<i>ln an insane world...</i>

752
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:56,685
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

753
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,348
Hey, let's try this one.

754
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,865
There we go.

755
01:29:21,582 --> 01:29:24,003
She said go south with him
like you planned.

756
01:29:24,045 --> 01:29:26,185
-She'll meet you tomorrow.
-Mom!

757
01:29:27,886 --> 01:29:29,032
Mom, wait!

758
01:29:43,666 --> 01:29:45,073
"No fate."

759
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:48,592
No fate but what we make.

760
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,497
My father told her this.

761
01:29:54,996 --> 01:29:59,119
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

762
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:02,579
Never mind.

763
01:30:02,612 --> 01:30:05,875
Okay, the whole thing goes--

764
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:08,527
The future's not set.

765
01:30:08,565 --> 01:30:11,980
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

766
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:14,957
She intends to change the future.

767
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:16,405
Yeah, I guess.

768
01:30:17,878 --> 01:30:19,666
Oh, shit!

769
01:30:19,702 --> 01:30:21,589
-Dyson.
-Yeah.

770
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:25,005
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

771
01:30:25,047 --> 01:30:27,022
She's gonna blow him away.

772
01:30:27,064 --> 01:30:29,038
Come on! Let's go!

773
01:30:40,954 --> 01:30:42,929
This is tactically dangerous.

774
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:44,050
Drive faster.

775
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:46,578
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

776
01:30:46,618 --> 01:30:49,935
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

777
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:52,369
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

778
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:54,298
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

779
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:56,120
I don't care!

780
01:30:56,697 --> 01:30:58,420
Haven't you learned anything yet?

781
01:30:58,457 --> 01:31:00,879
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

782
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:05,939
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

783
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:08,084
but everybody's not like that.

784
01:31:08,123 --> 01:31:11,572
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

785
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:17,526
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

786
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:56,704
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

787
01:31:56,739 --> 01:31:58,944
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

788
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:17,221
Danny, your time is up!

789
01:32:17,255 --> 01:32:20,102
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

790
01:32:47,466 --> 01:32:49,026
Danny!

791
01:33:00,139 --> 01:33:01,481
Daddy!

792
01:33:01,515 --> 01:33:03,904
Danny, go! Go!

793
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:06,566
Miles?

794
01:33:11,565 --> 01:33:13,932
-Tarissa, run!
-Oh, my God!

795
01:33:20,687 --> 01:33:22,662
Just take Danny and run!

796
01:33:22,703 --> 01:33:23,947
Run!

797
01:33:23,983 --> 01:33:25,707
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

798
01:33:43,794 --> 01:33:44,809
Daddy!

799
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,849
Nobody fucking move!

800
01:33:48,594 --> 01:33:49,839
Don't hurt my daddy!

801
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,401
On the floor, bitch.

802
01:33:51,441 --> 01:33:53,549
Get down now!

803
01:33:54,356 --> 01:33:55,436
Get out of the way!

804
01:33:55,476 --> 01:33:56,883
Don't hurt him!

805
01:33:58,292 --> 01:34:00,266
Get on the floor now!

806
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:04,848
Just let the boy go.

807
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:06,446
Shut up. Shut up.

808
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:07,762
Shut up!

809
01:34:07,797 --> 01:34:10,318
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

810
01:34:10,358 --> 01:34:12,562
-It's all your fault!
-What?

811
01:34:12,599 --> 01:34:14,639
I'm not gonna let you do it.

812
01:35:04,512 --> 01:35:06,584
Shit! We're too late!

813
01:35:10,847 --> 01:35:11,927
Check them.

814
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,398
Look at me, Mom.

815
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,580
Are you hurt?

816
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,049
I almost--

817
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:38,498
It'll be okay.

818
01:35:38,531 --> 01:35:40,419
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

819
01:35:41,924 --> 01:35:43,550
I promise.

820
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:49,508
You came here to stop me.

821
01:35:50,342 --> 01:35:52,230
Yeah, I did.

822
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:56,891
I love you, John.

823
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,030
I always have.

824
01:36:01,831 --> 01:36:03,238
I know.

825
01:36:09,928 --> 01:36:12,068
Deep penetration.

826
01:36:13,577 --> 01:36:15,464
No shattered bone.

827
01:36:15,497 --> 01:36:18,346
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

828
01:36:28,653 --> 01:36:30,026
Who are you people?

829
01:36:30,924 --> 01:36:32,332
Show him.

830
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:38,920
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

831
01:37:17,683 --> 01:37:18,928
Oh, my God.

832
01:37:18,965 --> 01:37:21,517
Now listen to me
very carefully.

833
01:37:27,157 --> 01:37:31,150
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

834
01:37:31,189 --> 01:37:34,932
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

835
01:37:34,966 --> 01:37:37,203
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

836
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:41,234
<i>lt's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

837
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:44,021
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

838
01:37:44,055 --> 01:37:45,942
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

839
01:37:47,832 --> 01:37:50,199
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

840
01:37:55,962 --> 01:37:58,034
You're judging me...

841
01:37:58,074 --> 01:38:00,440
on things I haven't even done yet.

842
01:38:04,474 --> 01:38:06,514
How were we supposed to know?

843
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,769
Yeah.

844
01:38:10,811 --> 01:38:13,147
Right.

845
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,253
How were you supposed to know?

846
01:38:16,252 --> 01:38:18,041
Fucking men like you...

847
01:38:18,077 --> 01:38:19,833
built the hydrogen bomb.

848
01:38:19,869 --> 01:38:22,390
Men like you...

849
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:23,837
thought it up.

850
01:38:27,519 --> 01:38:29,406
You think you're so creative.

851
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:33,752
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

852
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:35,897
to create a life...

853
01:38:35,936 --> 01:38:37,431
to feel it growing inside you.

854
01:38:37,472 --> 01:38:40,320
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

855
01:38:40,353 --> 01:38:42,012
Mom!

856
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:45,694
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

857
01:38:45,729 --> 01:38:47,769
We still have to stop this
from happening.

858
01:38:47,809 --> 01:38:50,560
But I thought--

859
01:38:50,594 --> 01:38:54,456
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

860
01:38:54,498 --> 01:38:59,168
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

861
01:38:59,202 --> 01:39:02,554
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

862
01:39:02,597 --> 01:39:04,452
That's not good enough.

863
01:39:04,485 --> 01:39:06,373
No one must follow your work.

864
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:08,228
Right.

865
01:39:08,261 --> 01:39:12,484
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab--

866
01:39:12,517 --> 01:39:14,078
the files, the disk drives...

867
01:39:14,117 --> 01:39:16,703
everything here.

868
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:18,748
Everything.

869
01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:20,678
I don't care.

870
01:39:21,863 --> 01:39:22,878
The chip.

871
01:39:22,919 --> 01:39:24,959
-Do you know about the chip?
-What chip?

872
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:27,366
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

873
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:30,050
The CPU from the first Terminator.

874
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:32,423
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

875
01:39:32,456 --> 01:39:35,107
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

876
01:39:35,144 --> 01:39:37,413
Those lying motherfuckers.

877
01:39:37,448 --> 01:39:39,206
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

878
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:40,387
It was smashed.

879
01:39:40,426 --> 01:39:43,939
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

880
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,920
Things we would've never--

881
01:39:47,979 --> 01:39:50,019
All my work was based on it.

882
01:39:50,059 --> 01:39:51,815
It must be destroyed.

883
01:39:53,963 --> 01:39:56,898
Can you get us in?
Past security?

884
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,948
I think so, yeah. When?

885
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:04,708
Now?

886
01:40:08,366 --> 01:40:11,335
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

887
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:14,277
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

888
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:16,972
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

889
01:40:17,009 --> 01:40:19,856
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

890
01:40:56,565 --> 01:40:58,453
Carl, right?

891
01:40:59,702 --> 01:41:03,019
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

892
01:41:03,062 --> 01:41:05,038
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

893
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:08,276
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

894
01:41:08,311 --> 01:41:10,384
I need written authorization--

895
01:41:11,383 --> 01:41:13,358
I insist.

896
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:15,124
Don't even think about it.

897
01:41:25,594 --> 01:41:27,001
It's okay.

898
01:41:28,346 --> 01:41:31,380
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

899
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:34,267
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

900
01:41:35,515 --> 01:41:36,922
Gibbons?

901
01:41:39,837 --> 01:41:41,625
Gibbons! Come on, man!

902
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:44,661
You can't leave the desk
like that!

903
01:41:49,278 --> 01:41:50,706
Oh, shit.

904
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:09,528
My card should access this.

905
01:42:13,954 --> 01:42:16,321
-What is it?
-Damn it.

906
01:42:16,353 --> 01:42:18,263
The silent alarm's been tripped.

907
01:42:24,163 --> 01:42:26,815
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

908
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:28,739
Nothing will open anywhere now.

909
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,556
We have to abort.

910
01:42:34,597 --> 01:42:37,893
We go all the way.
Okay?

911
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:43,620
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

912
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:46,021
-I think it's that guy from the mall.
-It is.

913
01:42:46,054 --> 01:42:47,941
It's him and the woman.

914
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:52,515
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

915
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,916
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

916
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:03,298
It's no good.

917
01:43:03,338 --> 01:43:04,799
Let me try mine.

918
01:43:09,579 --> 01:43:11,619
John, fire in the hole!

919
01:43:23,116 --> 01:43:27,786
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

920
01:43:34,607 --> 01:43:36,525
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

921
01:43:39,371 --> 01:43:40,615
Put this on.

922
01:43:53,996 --> 01:43:56,451
All right, let's get to work.

923
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,917
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

924
01:44:19,952 --> 01:44:24,623
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

925
01:44:24,657 --> 01:44:26,282
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

926
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:29,670
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

927
01:44:29,713 --> 01:44:32,561
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

928
01:44:32,593 --> 01:44:34,481
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

929
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:40,076
All the disks in my office...

930
01:44:40,114 --> 01:44:42,219
all the disks
in that office over there...

931
01:44:42,259 --> 01:44:44,202
everything behind my desk...

932
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:46,449
and all the processors
on my left.

933
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:48,973
We'll blow those with the CP4.

934
01:45:02,006 --> 01:45:03,435
Can l...

935
01:45:04,054 --> 01:45:05,779
Excuse me.

936
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:09,904
Can I borrow that thing?

937
01:45:18,618 --> 01:45:20,887
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

938
01:45:24,731 --> 01:45:26,870
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

939
01:45:26,907 --> 01:45:28,631
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

940
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:31,537
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

941
01:46:21,758 --> 01:46:23,417
All right.

942
01:46:23,455 --> 01:46:25,179
7-2-5-6.

943
01:46:31,873 --> 01:46:33,182
Easy money.

944
01:46:37,729 --> 01:46:39,135
Uh-oh.

945
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:44,097
Oh, shit. Not good.

946
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,523
How we doing?

947
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:52,221
Primer cord is set.

948
01:46:52,259 --> 01:46:54,627
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

949
01:46:58,339 --> 01:47:01,188
-How do we set them off?
-Remote control.

950
01:47:01,221 --> 01:47:03,555
Piece of cake.

951
01:47:03,589 --> 01:47:05,083
-We got company.
-Police?

952
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:08,388
-How many?
-All of 'em, I think.

953
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:09,765
Go. I'll finish here.

954
01:47:11,655 --> 01:47:13,063
Come on.

955
01:47:14,055 --> 01:47:15,942
I'll take care of the police.

956
01:47:15,975 --> 01:47:17,252
Wait! You swore!

957
01:47:20,072 --> 01:47:21,479
Trust me.

958
01:47:34,185 --> 01:47:35,779
<i>You at the window!</i>

959
01:47:35,819 --> 01:47:39,169
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

960
01:47:40,427 --> 01:47:42,215
Holy shit!

961
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:43,745
That's a mini-gun!

962
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:07,340
-Come on!
-Oh, shit!

963
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:08,903
Go! Go! Go!

964
01:48:54,518 --> 01:48:55,926
Fire!

965
01:49:12,537 --> 01:49:14,164
Same time, to the left.

966
01:49:14,203 --> 01:49:16,472
One, two, three, go.

967
01:49:28,093 --> 01:49:30,842
In order to get that out--

968
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,994
We got Skynet by the balls now.

969
01:49:40,030 --> 01:49:41,606
Come on, let's book.

970
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:44,275
Hold your fire!

971
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:10,615
-Ready to rock?
-Ready.

972
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:15,358
Time to go.

973
01:50:15,394 --> 01:50:16,823
Now.

974
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:19,735
-Take this. They'll use gas.
-Come on.

975
01:50:19,777 --> 01:50:22,779
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

976
01:50:46,024 --> 01:50:48,707
Mom! Mom!

977
01:51:31,246 --> 01:51:32,326
Shit!

978
01:51:33,678 --> 01:51:36,527
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

979
01:51:45,649 --> 01:51:46,630
Get down!

980
01:51:53,746 --> 01:51:55,153
Here.

981
01:52:19,606 --> 01:52:22,923
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

982
01:52:26,904 --> 01:52:28,366
Fall back!

983
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,968
Everybody out!

984
01:52:30,008 --> 01:52:31,863
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

985
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:07,708
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

986
01:53:38,307 --> 01:53:39,965
Shut your eyes.

987
01:53:46,275 --> 01:53:49,341
Stay here. I'll be back.

988
01:53:56,805 --> 01:53:59,074
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

989
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:03,164
On the floor now!

990
01:54:05,414 --> 01:54:06,876
Okay, drop him!

991
01:55:23,474 --> 01:55:24,881
Here, hold this.

992
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:42,511
Holy shit!

993
01:55:56,953 --> 01:55:57,934
Go!

994
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:36,181
Shit!

995
01:56:49,121 --> 01:56:50,746
Get out.

996
01:57:08,994 --> 01:57:10,304
Listen.

997
01:57:10,339 --> 01:57:12,958
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

998
01:57:12,996 --> 01:57:14,271
-You got it?
-Yeah.

999
01:57:14,307 --> 01:57:15,714
All right.

1000
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:30,882
Chopper's coming in!

1001
01:57:30,917 --> 01:57:31,998
It's him.

1002
01:58:27,409 --> 01:58:28,751
Shit!

1003
01:58:31,473 --> 01:58:33,229
Stay down!

1004
01:59:44,444 --> 01:59:46,167
Goddamn!

1005
01:59:46,204 --> 01:59:47,187
You okay--

1006
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:56,347
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

1007
01:59:58,142 --> 01:59:59,735
Take the shotgun.

1008
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:04,340
Are you hurt?

1009
02:00:16,994 --> 02:00:17,976
Holy shit.

1010
02:00:18,018 --> 02:00:19,840
Come on, Mom. Come on!

1011
02:00:19,873 --> 02:00:20,985
We need your truck.

1012
02:00:21,025 --> 02:00:22,486
Hurry!

1013
02:00:27,267 --> 02:00:29,722
-Come on. Hurry.
-Get in.

1014
02:00:32,546 --> 02:00:33,757
Go!

1015
02:00:39,492 --> 02:00:41,434
What the hell--

1016
02:00:47,045 --> 02:00:49,729
-I'm bleeding bad.
-Keep pressure on it.

1017
02:00:51,302 --> 02:00:52,894
Here. This'll work.

1018
02:00:58,247 --> 02:00:59,873
He's gaining.

1019
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:03,970
Step on it!

1020
02:01:04,008 --> 02:01:06,726
-This is the vehicle's top speed.
-I can run faster than this!

1021
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:18,506
Coming up, to the right.

1022
02:01:20,459 --> 02:01:22,346
Watch it! Watch it!

1023
02:01:43,983 --> 02:01:46,023
-Drive.
-Where are you going?

1024
02:01:53,169 --> 02:01:55,056
Take the off-ramp.

1025
02:02:04,307 --> 02:02:05,451
Shit!

1026
02:02:08,465 --> 02:02:09,480
Hold on!

1027
02:02:53,466 --> 02:02:55,058
Don't stop!

1028
02:03:02,555 --> 02:03:03,897
Go straight!

1029
02:03:06,428 --> 02:03:07,409
Look out!

1030
02:03:07,452 --> 02:03:08,435
Duck!

1031
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:24,062
Get the hell outta here!

1032
02:03:29,343 --> 02:03:32,310
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

1033
02:04:46,123 --> 02:04:48,513
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

1034
02:05:35,987 --> 02:05:37,394
We don't have much time.

1035
02:05:59,094 --> 02:06:00,338
Let's go.

1036
02:06:01,336 --> 02:06:03,027
We gotta get outta here.

1037
02:06:03,064 --> 02:06:05,103
Come on! Get up!

1038
02:06:18,104 --> 02:06:19,795
Hand me the shotgun.

1039
02:06:24,377 --> 02:06:26,583
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1040
02:06:27,355 --> 02:06:29,210
Hurry!

1041
02:06:32,604 --> 02:06:34,197
Come on, Mom.

1042
02:06:40,414 --> 02:06:41,691
Get up!

1043
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:13,758
This way. Come on.

1044
02:07:41,437 --> 02:07:44,023
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1045
02:07:44,061 --> 02:07:45,305
Go back.

1046
02:07:53,149 --> 02:07:55,354
-Go. Run.
-No! We gotta stick together.

1047
02:07:55,391 --> 02:07:57,334
John, you've got to go now.

1048
02:07:57,376 --> 02:07:59,481
-John!
-Go! Now!

1049
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,617
Get up the steps.

1050
02:09:14,475 --> 02:09:15,882
Go.

1051
02:09:19,693 --> 02:09:21,100
Get up.

1052
02:09:21,869 --> 02:09:23,909
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1053
02:09:56,947 --> 02:09:59,216
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1054
02:10:00,531 --> 02:10:03,118
Grab it. Go. Go!

1055
02:10:13,045 --> 02:10:16,210
Mom, come on! Mom!

1056
02:11:03,357 --> 02:11:05,113
Call to John.

1057
02:11:07,773 --> 02:11:09,562
I know this hurts.

1058
02:11:11,295 --> 02:11:12,888
Call John.

1059
02:11:28,609 --> 02:11:31,161
Call to John now.

1060
02:11:33,153 --> 02:11:34,942
Fuck you.

1061
02:14:44,416 --> 02:14:45,822
Help!

1062
02:15:05,504 --> 02:15:06,551
Mom.

1063
02:15:08,671 --> 02:15:10,559
Help me.

1064
02:15:13,056 --> 02:15:14,300
Get out of the way, John.

1065
02:15:17,505 --> 02:15:18,007
Shoot!

1066
02:16:11,014 --> 02:16:13,380
Get down!

1067
02:17:42,836 --> 02:17:44,941
Get up. Come on.

1068
02:17:47,092 --> 02:17:48,848
Holy shit.

1069
02:17:48,885 --> 02:17:51,253
I need a vacation.

1070
02:18:03,927 --> 02:18:06,645
Is it dead?

1071
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:08,087
Terminated.

1072
02:18:11,321 --> 02:18:13,011
Will this melt in there?

1073
02:18:15,833 --> 02:18:17,655
Yes. Throw it in.

1074
02:18:22,138 --> 02:18:23,121
Adios.

1075
02:18:24,442 --> 02:18:26,329
And the chip.

1076
02:18:40,861 --> 02:18:42,421
It's over.

1077
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:50,584
There's one more chip.

1078
02:18:55,039 --> 02:18:57,243
And it must be destroyed also.

1079
02:19:02,433 --> 02:19:03,994
Here.

1080
02:19:04,034 --> 02:19:07,330
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1081
02:19:19,907 --> 02:19:22,297
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1082
02:19:22,339 --> 02:19:24,576
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1083
02:19:24,611 --> 02:19:26,587
-It'll be okay.
-I have to go away.

1084
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:29,149
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1085
02:19:29,188 --> 02:19:32,156
I must go away, John.

1086
02:19:32,197 --> 02:19:33,659
No, wait.

1087
02:19:33,703 --> 02:19:35,164
You don't have to do this.

1088
02:19:35,207 --> 02:19:36,516
I'm sorry.

1089
02:19:37,384 --> 02:19:39,587
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1090
02:19:39,623 --> 02:19:41,510
It has to end here.

1091
02:19:42,664 --> 02:19:47,787
I order you not to go!

1092
02:19:53,448 --> 02:19:55,423
I know now why you cry.

1093
02:19:57,706 --> 02:20:00,095
But it's something
I can never do.

1094
02:20:32,975 --> 02:20:35,114
Goodbye.

1095
02:22:10,106 --> 02:22:13,073
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

1096
02:22:13,115 --> 02:22:16,912
<i>l face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

1097
02:22:16,955 --> 02:22:19,257
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

1098
02:22:19,292 --> 02:22:22,587
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

1099
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:24,988
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
